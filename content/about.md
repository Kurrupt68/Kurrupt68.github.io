## About Me

I'm Mathew Ayokunle Alabi, known online as `Kurrupt68`. I'm a cybersecurity researcher focused on penetration testing, vulnerability research, and offensive security. I work primarily with web applications, mobile applications, network infrastructure, and Artificial Intelligence, and enjoy the puzzle-solving aspects of discovering and analyzing vulnerabilities in systems.

My technical foundation includes programming in Python, C, and Bash, along with experience in various security tools and methodologies. I'm particularly interested in bug bounty programs, CTF challenges, and vulnerability research and analysis.

### Beyond Security

Outside of the technical realm, I'm genuinely interested in conversations with other curious minds. I believe that some of the most valuable insights come from connecting with people from different backgrounds and learning from their experiences and perspectives. Whether it's exploring new ideas, discussing philosophy, music, or simply understanding how others see the world, I find joy in these human connections.

I'm constantly expanding my horizons beyond my field, trying new things, and staying open to learning from all walks of life. I value meaningful conversations with people who are passionate about what they do, regardless of the domain. Life is richer when shared with interesting people who challenge the way you think.
